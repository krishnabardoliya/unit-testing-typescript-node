1) F.I.R.S.T Principle
F - Fast
- unit test should be fast

I- Isolated/Independent
- Test should be isolated from other test and external environment.
- no shared state between other test, test order not matter

R - Repeateble
- Same result with the same input
 Challenge: where random date/current date time are used -> need to mock it
- Test that writes to database should always cleanup

S - Self validating
- after test is finished it's result should be clear

T -Thorough

- Cover all cases/paths/scenarios
- Happy case/ Bad path/Edge cases
- Invalid input
- Large values
- 100% code coverage
