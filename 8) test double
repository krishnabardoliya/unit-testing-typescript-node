How we can use doubles?
ex: instead of pointing to production database, we can point to test database.

What are the test doubles?
- pretend object that are used in place of real object for testing purpose.
- Dummy object: Passed around but not used
- Fakes: Simplified working implementation, it takes a shortcut
ex: service access another, service that accesses another service like: login will just return true or false 

stubs: imcomplete object used as arguments 

mocks: preprogrammed with expectation

spies: Tracks information about how a unit is called.

mock modules:

Note for Jest: mocks and spies have a lot in common


===============================================
Mocks: most used, most debated
- the way we use them greatly influences the way we writes testcases.
- If we need to write it too much, there is something wrong in our code
- Testing/mocking style: London/Chicago
