Setup
- to avoid initial setup duplication for all testcases
- run relative to their "describe" block

beforeEach(() => {
    // it will execute before each case
})

afterEach(() => {
    // teardown
    // mostly used for clearing mocks
})


beforeAll(() => {
    // Can use for integration testing
    // only once before all test case runs
    // ex: we can put database connection code which is long and take too much time
})

afterAll(() => {
    // teardown
    // mostly used for clearing mocks
})
