Why we need automated tests?

> Peace of mind as a developer/tester
> Catch bugs early
    > Spend 1 hour for tests
    > Win 3 hours of debugging
> Unit tests impose high code quality
    > If a unit is too difficult to test, the code quality should be improved
> Prevent endless manual tests
> Think big: a TODO list doesn't need tests
